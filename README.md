# Path_tracking_control

**Implementation and Development of a Tractorâ€™s Path Tracking Algorithm Based on Dynamic Target Control**

This project presents a Dynamic Path Tracking Algorithm for autonomous tractors that eliminates pre-generated reference paths. Unlike the Pure Pursuit Algorithm, it dynamically adjusts target distances based on head and distance errors, accounting for steering and speed delays. Experiments with R-type and C-type turns demonstrate comparable accuracy to the Pure Pursuit Algorithm, providing an efficient and flexible solution. Additionally, the algorithm was modeled using a traditional bicycle model.
